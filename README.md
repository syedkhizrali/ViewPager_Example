# ViewPager_Example
An example to demonstrate view pager in android
The ViewPager is the widget that allows the user to swipe left or right to see an entirely new screen. 
In a sense, it's just a nicer way to show the user multiple tabs. 
It also has the ability to dynamically add and remove pages (or tabs) at anytime.
